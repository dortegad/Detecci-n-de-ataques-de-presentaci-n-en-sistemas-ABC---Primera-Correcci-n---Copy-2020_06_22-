\section{Conclusiones}
In this work, we explain how to use the puthesis.cls class file and the accompanying template.  


\section{Contribuciones}


\section{Trabajos futuros}
Future work should include options in the template for a masters thesis or an undergraduate senior thesis. It should also support running headings in the headers using the `headings' pagestyle.  The print mode and proquest mode included in the template might also be candidates to include in the class itself.
